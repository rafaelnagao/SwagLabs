## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This test was created to practice the concepts and ways of creating automated tests in Cypress.

I created this test for a job vacancy test. I hope the evaluators understand that I'm just starting out and I still have a lot to learn. 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### ‚õèÔ∏è Prerequisites
This test was built using:


- Visual Studio Code v1.77.3 [![VSCode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual_Studio_Code-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio%20code&logoColor=white)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Node.JS v18.15.0 [![Node.JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Git v2.40.0.windows.1 [![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/GIT-E44C30?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Cypress v12.10.0 [![cypress](https://img.shields.io/badge/-cypress-%23E5E5E5?style=for-the-badge&logo=cypress&logoColor=058a5e)](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress)


### Installing
After installing all the applications described above, make a local clone of the project and branch to your repository, so that all changes will be saved correctly.

Access the directory where the repository will be cloned and type:

```
$ git init
```

This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâa Git repository skeleton.

You clone a repository with git clone <url>. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called libgit2, you can do so like this:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rafaelnagao/SwagLabs.git
```

or by SSH (if you already have a key configured)

```
$ git clone git@github.com:rafaelnagao/SwagLabs.git
```

Open your cloned local directory and enjoy!

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
The tests are in the directory "~/SwagLabs/cypress/e2e/SwagLabs.cy.js"

You can go to the terminal and open Cypress or run it through the terminal itself.

```
npx cypress open
```
or
```
npx cypress run
```

### Break down into end to end tests
This test will test the login screen, with one login failed and another successful.

Another step will be to test include 3 items in the shopping cart, delete one of them and finalize the purchase.

The website possibly has an API issue, because it returns a site that is not secure, even though it is accessed as safe in the common browser.

I could possibly be wrong too, but the main mistake is that Cypress doesn't recognize page loading and returns an error.
